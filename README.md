# Website Challenge

Started with a bried chat to Amina about what to include. Then had a small chat about what design she's like where we ended up aiming for a slick design with Pastal/ Earthy Colours.

My first task was create the layout of the website. This took a little bit of time, ending up forcing each block into place using a larger block. Then I discovered flexbot. Never have I been so delighted and annoyed at the same time! It was wonderful, made instant improvements and was really easy! However it did make all the work I had put into my website completely redundant.

Changed the Colour Scheme a bit as I wanted a darker background, then filled it with her info. Added some social media tags at the bottom.
